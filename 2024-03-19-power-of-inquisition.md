The _Power of Inquestition_ is simply the asking of uncomfortable questions to those in or influence power -- political, social, technical, et al...

Historically reporters would report on facts of an issue and inform their readers so the polity could better keep themselves informed. 

Unfortunately, becuase of a failing of Journalistic Ethics, journalist today only report the facts they, their employers, or the Ruling Regime desires. Due to this failing, we training a new generation of factfinders or Inquisitors -- people who ask questions in order to get to the Truth of a matter. 

If you wish to help inform the public, you can contribute to our Inqusition by:

- sharing the True Name of the demons we are exorcizing, see Law of Names
- writing articles for Networked Publications
- building your own Syndication Network
- braving the demon hordes that undermine your home and showing support to those fighting against them
