No, Alex Van Aken is not a target of a harassment campaign. Alex conflates ideological disagreement with harassment.

[Alex Van Aken](https://twitter.com/itsVanAken){:target="_blank"} tweets

> Hundreds+ of people slinging insults at me, wishing death on me, messaging threats, slandering, etc. — yet so many claiming there’s no harassment happening.

> Notice I haven’t done the same to anyone?

> Disagree with me all you want, but at least understand what you’re involved in.

Following up the intitial Tweet, Van Aken said he was making it up and provided comically bad "evidence." His admission of "[Yeah man I’m making it up](https://x.com/itsVanAken/status/1768340367613612529?s=20){:target="_blank"}" might be the only true thing he said in the linked thread.
