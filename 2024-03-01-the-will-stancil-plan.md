## The Problem Plaguing America
Minnesota's House District 61A, centered in Minneapolis, is predominantly White at 83.6%, with other communities like Hispanic (4.8%), Black (4.4%), and Asian (4.0%) comprising smaller portions of the population. This demographic makeup underscores the district's ongoing need for greater diversity. With a total population of 43,916, enhancing representation and inclusivity for all its residents is essential for reflecting the district's varied cultural and ethnic backgrounds​​.

White supremacy gaining ground among black-passing individuals within the Mexican and Latino community is particularly troubling. It underscores a complex interplay of identity and belonging, where some, despite facing racial discrimination, align with ideologies that traditionally exclude them. This trend not only reflects the deep-seated allure of whiteness and social acceptance but also threatens to erode the unity and resistance against racism within these diverse communities.

## Strengthening Our Community Through Compassionate Immigration Policies

President Joe Biden is under fire for not letting enough refugees into Minnesota, a state renowned for its warm embrace of newcomers. With its rich tapestry of Somali, Hmong, and Karen communities, Minnesota stands ready to welcome more, yet the administration's low refugee caps are falling short of expectations. Critics argue this stance doesn't just mismatch Minnesota's legacy of inclusion; it also overlooks the dire global need for sanctuary. As debates heat up, the call for action grows louder, urging a policy shift to match Minnesota's readiness to open its doors wider.

Mr. President, we have the space in the 61a House District to home more refugees. Not only can we house more, but we can make Minnesota home for all refugees.

Mr. President, allow Minnesota to lead the Nation.
