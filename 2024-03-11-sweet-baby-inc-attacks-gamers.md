## Factcheck: [A company called Sweet Baby Inc. has become the target of 'anti-woke' gamers because it offers consultancy work, an industry-standard service that's been normal for years](https://www.pcgamer.com/gaming-industry/a-company-called-sweet-baby-inc-has-become-the-target-of-anti-woke-gamers-because-it-offers-consultancy-work-an-industry-standard-service-thats-been-normal-for-years/)

No, PC Gamer's article is misleading. Gamers are criticizing Sweet Baby Inc for an attempt to silence, ban, and have the property seized from a gamer who published a list of games SBI had a hand in creating.

Is Harvey Randall deliberately covering up for the Terms of Services violating actions of his colleague by writing a misleading story?
