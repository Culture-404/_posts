## Worldbuilding Platform for Creatives

With your donations, I promise to produce a Digital Trading Card Game similar to Hearthstone to compete directly against Blizzard. The Warcraft Universe was brilliant and lovable but became infected with ideological rot from within and has not produced good content in years. We exist to be milked of our dollars by people who hate us.

The Digital Trading Card Game will focus on simple yet fun gameplay, solo and with your friends, PvP and PvE. It will be up to the players to determine the narratives -- the game itself will only provide a basic structure, a canvas for your creativity. Better Writers, Dungeon Masters, et al, will be free to create, run, and sell campaigns based on the in game universe and ruleset. 

The authors of these campaigns and other contributors will receive royalties for their work. This means artists on card design, musicians for background ambiance, voice actors, sound effects, and more will be compensated as well. This Digital Trading Card Game is about growing an ecosystem of talent and discover a vector of divestment from the established video gaming industry and into one that builds games for gamers. We will leverage an existing, or create a new blockchain to manage the royalty payments and automate it -- Completely open and audit-able by the public. 

This proposal comes down to two fundamental game design beliefs:

- Empower Creatives
- Make Fun Games We Like Playing

We know the kind of games we want to play, we know that they will not let us have these games. They even hinder plugin and addons from reaching players if it makes the game better. We need more independant developers commited to making fun games.

This is a war of attrition. This proposal, if done alone, is just a foxhole against the woke mob. A foxhole they cannot pry me out of. Every donation makes it bigger until it becomes trench in which you or any displaced creative can join the fight!  

We will win; [We can stay retarded longer than they can stay solvent](https://youtu.be/DJc25vro7zo?si=DnzGDLY_BMWBMo9i&t=142)!
