Alyssa Mercante is a racist that browbeats videogame developers into promoting her religious beliefs.

Alyssa does not believe in diversity. She cultivates hostile work and gaming environments and then leads online hate campaigns to silence gamers, especially gamers with disabilities that cannot defend themselves against her witch-hunting tactics.

Lastly, Alyssa chronically lies to sway the mobs she riles up in order for them to be sympathetic to her. Sheâ€™s a professional victim and will probably claim this site itself is an attack against her. She views Truths as something hostile, not something to be understood.

### Video Games, Sports, and Other Social Spaces

All the spaces you grew up enjoying will become better overnight without people like Alyssa and the people that employ her in the industry. If we had a marketplace of ideas no one would know her name.
