## Factcheck: [Why are Valve and Discord permitting harassment against Sweet Baby Inc.?](https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/why-are-valve-and-discord-permitting-harassment-against-sweet-baby-inc-#close-modal)

[Bryant Francis](https://twitter.com/RBryant2012) omits the the fact that Sweet Baby Inc was the harasser and other relevant facts.  We rank this article as FALSE, a one out of five on the Truth Scale -- the lowest score available.  

## Ommited Facts

[Chris Kindred](https://twitter.com/itskindred) used their X/Twitter following of tens of thousands of followers to rile up a hate mob against a young Brazilian gamer, [Kabrutus](https://twitter.com/kabrutusrambo), who curated a list of games. Had their efforts succeeded he would have lost his decades old videogame collection. 

Recently Chris Kindred made racist statements about Toriyama's Dragonball Z series. This drew criticism from DBZ fans, "forcing" Chris to take his account private, presumably out of embarrassment.

[Alyssa Mercante](https://twitter.com/alyssa_merc), a racist and senior editor at [Kotaku](https://twitter.com/kotaku), "infiltrated" a public discord group in an attempt to dox its members. She was rightfully removed from the group for violation of Discord's harassment policies. 

## Summary 
Bryant Francis seems to deliberately omit critical information that the user would have interest in knowing to influence a false [narrative](https://imgur.com/TyAi6hW). 

While we have seen zero evidence that Valve or Discord are tolerating harassment, it appears that Twitter is allowing users like Chris and Alyssa to organize hate mobs that harass others, not Valve and Discord. We rate his article a False.
