## Factcheck: [Sweet Baby Inc. Doesnâ€™t Do What Some Gamers Think It Does](https://kotaku.com/sweet-baby-inc-consulting-games-alan-wake-2-dei-1851312428)

The article is misleading, [Kataku](https://twitter.com/kotaku) omits inconvenient facts about the Sweet Baby Inc scandal, such as how [Alyssa Mercante](https://alyssamercante.com/alyssa-mercante-about), an avowed racist that works for Kataku, attempted to acquire anonymous users'  private data in which started the online controversy.

Another key omission is [Chris Kindred's attempt to rile up a hate mob](https://alyssamercante.com/are-valve-and-discord-permitting-harassment-against-sweet-baby-inc) to censor critics. 

Reporting that deliberately misleads readers casts suspicion upon Kataku and other outlets journalistic ethics. 

## Summary
Kataku omits key facts in what appears to be an attempt to cover up their doxxing and harassment campaign.
