When the [True Name](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/True_name){:target="_blank" .link-dark} is known to the user, you invoke power over it. 
{: .lead.fs-4 }

The Law of Names states that if one knows the True Name of a person, object, or institution, they command a power over it. 

After a demon's name is identified, Inquisitors may publish their findings into that demon under it's listing in the [Book of Demons](#book-of-demons){: .link-dark } -- or our catalog of factchecks into prominent journalists.

Warning: The names listed here are of dangerous entities. They will lie, cheat, and deceive you if given the chance and have a proven history of great deceptions. Do not engage with them directly unless you know what you are doing.

Their names link to the binding of the Demon Name to our Sigil of Warding, or a public listing of factchecks and articles about them and the articles to which the demon has signed their name. Everything we, Inquisitors, Archivists, and Exorcists, publish must be truth, otherwise it only empowers demonic entities.
